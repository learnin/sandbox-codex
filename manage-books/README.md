# Manage Books

This is a simple library management application built with React.
It uses the browser's IndexedDB to store a list of books locally.

## Setup
Install dependencies with `npm install` from the `manage-books` directory.

## Usage
After installing dependencies, open `index.html` in a modern browser. The app
uses Babel in the browser to compile JSX, so no build step is required. You can
add books with a title and author. The data is stored in IndexedDB so it
persists between page reloads.
